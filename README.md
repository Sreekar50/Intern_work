Scraped recipes from food.com(3.5 lakh) using selenium and beautifulsoup. Preprossed the recipes to clean the data and applied text tokenization(recipeBERT). Then used fine tuned neural network model to achieve R2 score of 0.93. Also developed RAG model to answer recipe related questions with high accuracy using hybrid retrival combination of BM25+Densesearch and LlaMa 7b for generation of recipes relevant to questions and LlaMa 3b for evaluating the generated responses.
