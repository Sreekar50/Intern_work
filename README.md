Scraped recipes from Food.com(3.5 lakh) which is a dynamic website, using selenium and beautifulsoup. Preprocessed the recipes to clean the data and applied text tokenization(recipeBERT). Then used fine tuned neural network model to achieve R2 score of 0.93. Also developed RAG model to answer recipe related questions with high accuracy using Langchain, FAISS vector database and LLMs like mistral, openAI. Used hybrid retrival combination of BM25 + Densesearch and LlaMa 7b for generation of recipes relevant to questions using retrived recipes as context and LlaMa 3b for evaluating the generated responses.
