      "Coherence: 4/5 - The recipe is generally easy to follow, with clear instructions and logical steps. However, I would suggest rephrasing step 5 to emphasize that the eggs are cooked for 1 minute on the stovetop before being transferred to the oven.\n",

      "Answer Relevance: 1.5/5 - While the total preparation time is listed as 5 minutes, the actual cooking time is only 6-8 minutes (3-4 minutes per side). This discrepancy makes the recipe less relevant to the initial promise of a quick and easy dinner or snack solution.\n",
